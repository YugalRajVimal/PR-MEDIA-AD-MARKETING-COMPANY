            We know how Amazon’s algorithm operates, every 2.5 hours, rankings

            Hitting #1 is just the beginning, staying there is even more
            challenging. With our system, books rarely drop quickly after
            reaching the top. Many maintain their #1 status for weeks, even
            months. This kind of visibility is invaluable—but only if you act at
            the right time.
